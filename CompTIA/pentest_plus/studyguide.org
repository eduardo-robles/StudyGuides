** Chapter 1

*** Planning and Engagement - Objective 1.1, 1.2
**** Planing and Scoping
   - Get Permission
   - Know how much work you have to do
     - Don't do more than that
   - Watch out for scope creep

**** Importance of Planning
   - Each section of pentest is important
- Lots of options in each step
- Each pentest often conducted differently
- Easy to waste time and effort
  - Experience helps avoid this
- Project managment skills

**** Target Audience and Roe
- Know you  target audience
  - Who is sponsoring the pen test?
  - What is the purpose for the test?
- Rules of engagement governs the pen testers's activities.
  - Schedule - start, stop, temporal restrictions
  - Team composition, location, access
- Test scope
  - Technical/physcial/personnel
- Communication
  - Internal/external

- Risks of pen testing
  - Crashing devices, services, whole servers
  - Corrupting data
  - Degrading performance
  - Terms of Service/regulatoin/legislation violatoin
- Communicattion escalation path
  - Who to contact if things go wrong
  - Communication expectation (content, trigger, frequency)

**** Regulatory Compliance Considerations
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
  - Industry standard of security
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
  - EU regulation
  - Data protection and privacy for all individuals
***** Statements of Work can be attached to Master Service Agreements

***** Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
- Agreement that defines confidentiality, restrictions and/or sharing information
- Clients cannot talk about your work
- Pentester cannot talk about the work they did for the client

**** Environmental Differences

***** Export restrictions
restrictions

**** MITRE

***** A Framework to help keep you organized in your work

**** OWASP

***** Open Web Application Security Project

****** Provides tools and frameworks for real attacks

*** Exam Essentials
**** Know how the CIA and DAD triads describe the goals of cybersecurity professionals and attackers.
**** Be able to name several important benefits of penetration testing.
**** Describe how both internal and exteranl teams conduct penetration tests
**** Know the four phases of penetration testing process
**** Describe the tools by penetration testers.

*** Lab Exercises

**** 1.1 Adopting the Hacker mindset
Think about the grocery store where you normally shop. What are some the security measures used by that store to prevent the theft of cash merchandise? What ways can you think of to defeat those controls?

**** 1.2 Using the Cyber Kill Chain
Choose a real-world example of a cybersecurity incident from recent news. Select an example in which there is a reasonable amount of technical detail publicly available.

Describe this attack in terms of the Cyber Kill Chain. How did the attacker carry out each step of the process? Were any steps skipped? If there is not enough information available to definitely address an element of the Cyber Kill Chain, offer some assumptions about what may have happened.

*** Review Questions
**** Tom is running a penetration test in a web application and discovers a flaw that allow him to shut down the web server remotely. What goal of penetration testing has Tom most directly achieved?
Integrity
**** Brian ran a penetration test against a school's grading system and discovered a flaw that would allow students to alter their grades by exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability. What type of control should he recommend to the school's cybersecurity team to prevent students from engaging in this type of activity?
Confidentiality
**** Edward Snowden gathered a massive quantity of senstive information from the National Security Agency and released it to the media without permission. What type of attack did he wage?
Availability
**** Assuming no significant changes in an organization's cardholder data environment, how often does PCI DSS require that a merchant accepting credit cards conduct penetration testing?
Annually
**** Which one of the following in /not/ a benefit of using an internal penetration testing team?
Cost
**** Which one of the following is /not/ a reason to conduct periodic penetration test of systems and applications?
Cost
**** Rich recently got into trouble with a client for using an attack tool during a penetration test that caused a system outage. During what stage of the penetration testing process should Rich and his clients have agreed on the tools and techniques that he would use during the test?
Planning and Scoping
**** Which one of the following steps of the Cyber Kill Chain does /not/ map to the Attacking and Exploiting stage of the penetration testing process?
Actions on Objectives
**** Beth recently conducted a phishing attack against a penetratin testing target in an attempt to gather credentials that she might use in later attacks. What stage of the penetration testing process is Beth in?
Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning
**** Which one of the following security assessment tools is not commonly used during the Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning phase of a penetration test?
Metasploit
**** During what phase o fht Cyber Kill chain does and attacker steal information, use computing resources, or alter information without permission?

Command and Control
**** Which of the following activities assumes that an organizations has already been compromised?
Threat Hunting
